% ##### 2). Add lipids with constant values to the list of absolute lipids:
% ###

% Note: There is a set of structural lipids which are part of the species 
% listed for samples under standard conditions. Those species that were not
% measured in the plants under darkness, are assumed to bear a constant
% value!

% Eliminate lipids measured under darkness from data set of constant lipids:
includedControl(includedControl == 0) = ''; 
constantLipids = QLipidsControl;
constantLipids(includedControl,:) = '';

% Eliminate lipid classes that are not part of the data set of constant lipids:
notConstant = {'PC', 'PE', 'PG', 'PS', 'PI', 'DG', 'TG', 'MGDG', 'DGDG', 'SQDG'};
constantAbb = extractBefore(constantLipids(:,1), ' ');
idxNonStrc = ismember(constantAbb, notConstant);
constantLipids(idxNonStrc == 1,:) = '';

% Add constant values to list of absolute lipids:
[idxAbsolute,idxConstant] = ismember(absoluteLipids(:,1), constantLipids(:,1));
idxAbsolute(1) = 0;
idxConstant(1) = 0;
constantS = constantLipids((idxConstant(idxConstant ~= 0)),3);
absoluteLipids((idxAbsolute==1),5:end) = repmat(constantS,1,((size(absoluteLipids,2)-4)));

% ##### 3). Find lipid species that were identified under standard conditions 
% ###       but were not detected in the samples exposed to stress:
missingIdx = cellfun(@isempty, absoluteLipids(:,5:end));
missingIdx = sum(missingIdx,2);
missingStress = absoluteLipids(missingIdx ~= 0, 1);
missingAbsolute = LipidsUnderDetection(missingStress, absoluteLipids, 1, lipidRatios);
absoluteLipids(missingIdx ~= 0, 5:end) = cellstr(string(missingAbsolute));

% ###
% ##### 4). Find lipid species that were identified in samples exposed to stress
% ###       but were not detected in the samples under standard conditions:
includedInRatios = QLipidsControl(includedControl,1);
missingControl = setdiff(lipidRatios(1,2:end),includedInRatios);
missingAbsolute = LipidsUnderDetection(missingControl', absoluteLipids, 2, lipidRatios);
missingControl = [missingControl',cell(numel(missingControl),1)];
missingControl = [missingControl, cellstr(string(missingAbsolute))];
absoluteLipids = [absoluteLipids;missingControl];
